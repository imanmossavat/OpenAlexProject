## Presentations

### `FertelizerPrediction Presentation part 1.pptx` – Findings from the Crawler

- Audience-facing deck that validates crawler output against a researcher’s expectations for fertilizer application rate prediction / precision agriculture.
- Summarizes analysis of ~7,000 papers answering questions about venues, experts, openness, subfields, and reliability (including retraction spikes).

### `FertelizerPrediction Presentation part 2.pptx` – Technical Workflow Overview

- Explains how the crawler works end-to-end on a high level (inputs, OpenAlex enrichment, citation expansion, filtering/ranking, structuring, Obsidian export).
- Positions the crawler as a research navigation system that mirrors a human workflow (seed inputs → matching → crawling → structuring → vault export).

### `Survey Finalized.md` – Researcher Interview Questionnaire

- Question for user interviews to capture how researchers currently explore fields, validate crawler outputs, and integrate the vault into their workflow.

### `Vaultwithideasfornext/` – Ideas for Next Iterations

- Contains an Obsidian-style vault with worked-out ideas from the company mentor (`Overview reformated.md` plus detailed markdown notes inside `Ideas/`).
- Each idea describes potential enhancements, rationale, and when applicable why certain proposals are not feasible right now.
